* 
* This program examines all possible states of a game of solitaire,
* eliminating duplicates with a hashset. Still in testing.
*
* Future versions will calculate the percentage of winnable solitaire
* games, the best available move to make given a state (and unknown
* face-down cards), or even good general strategies to use when
* playing.
